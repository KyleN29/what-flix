# What-flix
## Description
What-flix is a personalized movie recommendation system that helps users quickly
find films they are likely to enjoy across multiple streaming platforms. The
application allows users to create accounts, select the streaming services they
subscribe to, rank genres, and rate movies they have seen. Based on these
preferences, What-flix generates tailored recommendations using factors such as
genre, popularity, similarity to liked movies, actors and directors. Each movie
listing includes a trailer link and information on which platforms offer the
film. The frontend uses React and the backend uses Node.js with Express along
with MongoDB for the database. The application is deployed on Render.

## Deployment Details
Our website is hosted at https://what-flix.onrender.com/. It may take a minute to
load since Render stops the application when not in use for a long period of time.
Render automatically verifies our changes made to main and deploys them to the live
application.
## Running locally
The application can be run locally by following the guide in CONTRIBUTING.md. However,
API keys will need to be created yourself, or request them from one of our team members.
