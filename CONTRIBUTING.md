# Contributing

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Install Node and npm

Go to https://nodejs.org/en/download and run the installer.

Verify installed correctly by running `node -v` and `npm -v`

### Step 2: Clone and enter the repository

`git clone https://github.com/KyleN29/what-flix.git` `cd what-flix`

### Step 3: Running the environment

The frontend and backend need to be run separately in development.

In separate terminals, run the following commands in the root directory.

Frontend: `npm run frontend`

Backend: `npm run backend`

### Step 4: Making changes

No changes should be directly added to main. All changes should be made in a
separate branch and then merged with a pull request.

To create a branch run `git checkout -b <type>/<name>`.

Type should describe the type of change your branch will make. The type should
be feature, style, fixes, or refactor. The name should be a short title to
describe the branch.

Example `git checkout -b feature/project-skeleton`

### Step 5: Submitting changes

Once you are finished implementing your features, you should create a pull
request to merge with main.
