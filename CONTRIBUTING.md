## Setup Guide

### Step 1: Install Node and npm
Go to https://nodejs.org/en/download and run the installer.

Verify installed correctly by running ```node -v``` and ```npm -v```

### Step 2: Clone the repository
```git clone https://github.com/KyleN29/what-flix.git```

### Step 3: Running the environment
The frontend and backend need to be run separately in development.

In separate terminals, run the following commands in the root directory.

Frontend: ```npm run frontend```

Backend: ```npm run backend```

### Step 3: Making changes
No changes should be directly added to main. All changes should be made in a separate branch and then merged with a pull request.

To create a branch run ```git checkout -b <type>/<name>```. 

Type should describe the type of change your branch will make. The type should be feature, style, fixes, or refactor. The name should be a short title to describe the branch.

Example ```git checkout -b feature/project-skeleton```

### Step 4: Submitting changes
Once you are finished implementing your features, you should create a pull request to merge with main.
