The application allows users to create accounts, select the streaming services they subscribe to, rank genres, and rate movies they have seen. Based on these preferences, What-flix generates tailored recommendations using factors such as genre, popularity, similarity to liked movies, actors and directors. Each movie listing includes a trailer link and information on which platforms offer the film. The frontend uses React and the backend uses Node.js with Express along with MongoDB for the database. The application is deployed on Render.",
